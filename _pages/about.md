I'm a third-year master's student at [SIGS](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Tian Guan](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/gt/main.htm). During this period, I also served as a research assistant at [SMART Lab, HKUST](https://hkustsmartlab.netlify.app/) under the supervision of [Hao Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z_t5DjwAAAAJ). Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree from [Hunan University](https://www.hnu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Qinghui Hong](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6210-6033). I'm working towards using deep learning methods to solve clinical issues in computational pathology.
